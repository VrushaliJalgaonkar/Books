“Chapter 1. Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications”


# Summary: Foundations of Data-Intensive Applications

Modern applications are increasingly data-intensive rather than compute-intensive. The bottlenecks developers face are less about CPU performance and more about managing vast, complex, and fast-changing data. These applications are typically constructed using foundational components that fulfill recurring needs:

- **Databases**: For reliable data storage and retrieval.
- **Caches**: To store the results of expensive operations for faster access.
- **Search Indexes**: To enable keyword-based and filtered searches.
- **Stream Processing**: For asynchronous communication between processes.
- **Batch Processing**: To analyze large volumes of accumulated data periodically.

While these tools have become ubiquitous and are often taken for granted, they embody powerful abstractions. Developers rarely build such systems from scratch, relying instead on mature technologies designed for these purposes.

However, selecting and integrating the right systems is not trivial. Each data system offers different characteristics to suit varying application needs. This chapter introduces key objectives—**reliability**, **scalability**, and **maintainability**—as guiding principles for designing robust data architectures. By understanding these fundamentals, developers can make informed decisions and navigate the trade-offs in building data-intensive systems. The upcoming chapters delve deeper into these systems, exploring their core principles and design choices layer by layer.
