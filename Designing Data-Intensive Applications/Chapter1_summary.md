# Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications


## Summary: Foundations of Data-Intensive Applications

Modern applications are increasingly data-intensive rather than compute-intensive. The bottlenecks developers face are less about CPU performance and more about managing vast, complex, and fast-changing data. These applications are typically constructed using foundational components that fulfill recurring needs:

- **Databases**: For reliable data storage and retrieval.
- **Caches**: To store the results of expensive operations for faster access.
- **Search Indexes**: To enable keyword-based and filtered searches.
- **Stream Processing**: For asynchronous communication between processes.
- **Batch Processing**: To analyze large volumes of accumulated data periodically.

While these tools have become ubiquitous and are often taken for granted, they embody powerful abstractions. Developers rarely build such systems from scratch, relying instead on mature technologies designed for these purposes.

However, selecting and integrating the right systems is not trivial. Each data system offers different characteristics to suit varying application needs. This chapter introduces key objectives—**reliability**, **scalability**, and **maintainability**—as guiding principles for designing robust data architectures. By understanding these fundamentals, developers can make informed decisions and navigate the trade-offs in building data-intensive systems. The upcoming chapters delve deeper into these systems, exploring their core principles and design choices layer by layer.

## Summary: Thinking About Data Systems

<INSERT:TODO> chapter1_img1.png

In today’s landscape, the lines between traditional data tools like databases, queues, and caches are increasingly blurred. While they once served distinct purposes, modern systems often combine these components, resulting in hybrid solutions like Redis (a cache and datastore) or Kafka (a queue with durability guarantees). These shifts challenge traditional classifications and push us to think of them collectively as **data systems**.

Modern applications have complex and demanding requirements that no single tool can meet. As a result, developers often compose specialized tools into a custom architecture, stitching them together through application logic. This turns application developers into **data system designers**, responsible for ensuring consistency, performance, and scalability across components.

The book focuses on three foundational concerns for designing such systems:
- **Reliability** – the system works correctly even when things go wrong.
- **Scalability** – the system can handle growth efficiently.
- **Maintainability** – the system remains adaptable and easy to evolve over time.

These principles guide engineers in navigating complex trade-offs, avoiding hidden pitfalls, and building robust, long-lasting systems. This chapter sets the stage for deeper exploration of the tools, patterns, and architectural decisions required to meet these goals.
