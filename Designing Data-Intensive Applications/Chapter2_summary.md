## Chapter 2: Data Models and Query Languages

Data models shape how software is designed, influencing both implementation and thought processes. Applications often stack multiple data models, from real-world abstractions to hardware-level bytes. Each layer hides complexity, enabling collaboration and modularity. Choosing the right data model—relational, document, or graph—is critical, as each has strengths and trade-offs. This chapter explores these models and their query languages, laying the groundwork for understanding how data is stored and queried in modern systems.
